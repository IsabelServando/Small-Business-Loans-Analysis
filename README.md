# Small-Business-Loans-Analysis
Analysis and Prediction of outcomes of Small Business Loans

For my EDA Class at UCLA Extension. The dataset had almost 1M rows (took a week to clean on Excel, crashing my MacBook Pro often, but took about a day in R though I had to refine more than a few times too). Thoroughly enjoyed this mad exercise. The dataset is pretty big so can't upload it here without jumping a few hoops so here's the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hd5R-y6PCsLLMYnTVZ3J0cdgfW2Fs5l5/view?usp=sharing
Please see PDF for the visualizations, learnings and conclusion, and the R file for this extremely OC exercise. This is how I learned to appreciate R and data cleaning.

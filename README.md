# Small-Business-Loans-Analysis
Analysis and Prediction of outcomes of Small Business Loans
The task was 1) to uncover what factors can determine whether a small business can pay off its loans (otherwise, the Small Business Agency or SBA woud have to write it off) and 2) whether the SBA does indeed help create/retain jobs as it's intended to.

Findings:
These factors do have a bearing on whether a small business defaults on its loan or pays it off:
_ the loan term
_ having a revolving credit line
- being an existing or new business
- the amount disbursed for a loan
- the amount guaranteed by SBA 

Moreover, SBA does help create and retain jobs. Not enough to make headlines however. 
But it just shows how much of an investment it takes to generate employment.

OTHER NOTES: 
My most thorought data cleaning job thus far, and how I learned to appreciate R and data cleaning. The dataset had almost 900k rows (took a week to clean on Excel, crashing my MacBook Pro often, but took about a day in R though I had to refine more than a few times too). 

Thoroughly enjoyed this mad exercise. The dataset is pretty big so can't upload it here without jumping a few hoops so here's the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hd5R-y6PCsLLMYnTVZ3J0cdgfW2Fs5l5/view?usp=sharing

Please see PDF for the visualizations, learnings and conclusions, and the R file for this extremely OC exercise.

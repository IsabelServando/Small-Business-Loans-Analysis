# Small-Business-Loans-Analysis
Analysis and Prediction of outcomes of Small Business Loans


This was for my EDA Class at UCLA Extension. A massive undertaking: the dataset had close to a million observations (took a week to clean on Excel, crashing my MacBook Pro a few times, but took about a day in R though I had to refine more than a few times too). Thoroughly enjoyed this mad exercise. The dataset is also pretty big so can't upload it here so easily.
